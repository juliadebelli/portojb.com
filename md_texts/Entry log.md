Here is a sample text that marks the beginning of this collection of words.

I write my stuff in markdown, call a node command called poster and it posts all .md texts as html pages.

This blog is designed to display academic articles about my research in technology, design and in-betweens.

At <a href="https://juliadebelli.com/blog" target="_blank">my other blog</a> you can find less serious writings, experiments and comics.
