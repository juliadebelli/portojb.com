<p>Here is a sample text that marks the beginning of this collection of words.</p>
<p>I write my stuff in markdown, call a node command called poster and it posts all .md texts as html pages.</p>
<p>This blog is designed to display academic articles about my research in technology, design and in-betweens.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://juliadebelli.com/blog" target="_blank">my other blog</a> you can find less serious writings, experiments and comics.</p>
<p>Cheers ðŸ¥‚</p>
